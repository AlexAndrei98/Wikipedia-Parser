This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs ([[serotonin releasing agents]]) such as in the case of [[MDMA]]. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated due an SRA, since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]]. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of [[neurotoxic]] effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n",

Some doctors choose to switch a patient to [[Fluoxetine|Prozac]] (fluoxetine) when discontinuing citalopram as fluoxetine has a much longer half-life (i.e. stays in the body longer compared to citalopram). This may avoid many of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with citalopram discontinuation. This can be done either by administering a single 20&nbsp;mg dose of fluoxetine or by beginning on a low dosage of fluoxetine and slowly tapering down. Either of these prescriptions may be written in liquid form to allow a very slow and gradual tapering down in dosage.
